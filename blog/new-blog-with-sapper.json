This blog is built with Sapper powered by Svelte!","html":"\n<p>I have been a big fan of Svelte for a while. Putting together a handful of personal playground applications. I feel in love with it's simplicity, integrated CSS, and performance.\nThe only caveat of Svelte, is that it is not as widely used as React or Vue, and while I been professionally working with React, I wish I would be using Svelte for commercial use more often.\nIf you are unfamiliar with Svelte I can highly recommend Rich Harris talk on the subject - Rethinking Reactivity.
