{"title":"Review Player","slug":"review-player","thumbnail":"reviewplayer.png","paragraph":"Review Player is an animiation player written in ReactJS, which allows for step framing, flip/flop, browse through all submissions and paint overs.","html":"\n<p>JavaScript was not built for handling video, and nothing like building a\nmedia player demonstrates that. Currently studios rely on desktop media players\nfor reviewing shot and asset development, and while it works, it can introduce challenges\nwhen teams are distributed across locations, and on different sets. Incoorperating a web application\nin the internal review process, seems like a natural progression. Especially since\nbrowsers included the requestAnimationFrame, and the canvas element, which has made it all the more plausible.\n</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/wxeEcQq.png\" />\n<p>Request Animation Frame is a feature of modern browsers that lets you run javascript functions, before the next frame is rendered.\nI use it to validate that the current time of the played video is within the frame range specified in the user interface. Another\npretty cool feature of the review player is that you can write on notes on top of the frame, (meanwhile the mirror function of the player is respected).\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Review Player is part of <a href=\"/projects/framethrower\">framethrower</a> which is not open source.\nI will make sure to link to the application when it is online.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Review Player is written in JavaScript using React and Material UI for interface elements.\n</p>\n\t\t"}
